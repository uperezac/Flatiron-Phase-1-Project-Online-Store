Welcome to the DIOR(lite) shopping site. Our goal was to create a functional online shopping site with a sleek and modern design. We organized the products and their prices into a grid to simulate an online shopping experience. In the header of the site, we have buttons that navigate to the particular product class (Clicking on JEANS will take you to jeans on the site). The HOME button takes you to the top of the page. Below each product is an interactive shopping bag logo that adds the product to the overall cart, which opens to the right side of the page when the shopping bag logo on in the header. Every product that has been added to the cart via the clicking the small bag under the product’s picture will appear in the overall cart. If the product has already been added to the cart and you click to add it again - you will get a notification that reminds you that the product is already in the cart. In the overall cart, the product picture, named, and price appear. There is an arrow where you can increase or decrease the units of the product (the total price in the overall cart updates according to the total price in that overall cart. Once you click on “Buy Now” you will receive a message that your “Order has been placed” and the overall cart will clear the product(s) and the corresponding data. We have included a trash icon that clears the overall cart. Whenever you hover over the the product picture, the image pops up (adding some flair to the shopping experience).
